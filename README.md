# CDA-Group-Project
CDA3103 – Computer Logic and Organization
Project Description
1. Introduction
In this project, you are asked to write the core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM
using the C programming language on a Unix platform. Your MySPIM will demonstrate functions
of the MIPS processor as well as the principle actions of the datapath and the control signals of a
MIPS processor. The simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the
format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle. You are
required to implement the processor simulation as a single-cycle datapath. You are asked to fill
in the body of several functions in the provided project file.
2. Specification of the simulator
2.1. Instructions to be simulated
The 14 instructions listed in Appendix A, Figure 1 are to be simulated. Please refer to the tables
in the MIPS Reference PowerPoint in Module 5 for the machine codes of these instructions.
Note that you are NOT required to treat situations leading to exceptions, interrupts, or changes
in the status register.
2.2. Registers to be handled
MySPIM should handle the 32 general purpose registers.
2.3. Memory usage
 The size of memory of MySPIM is 64kB (Addresses 0x0000 to 0xFFFF).
 The system assumes that all programs start at memory location 0x4000.
 All instructions are word-aligned in the memory, i.e., the addresses of all instructions
are a multiple of 4.
 The simulator (and the MIPS processor itself) treats the memory as one segment. (The
division of memory into text, data, and stack segments is only done by the
compiler/assembler.)
 At the start of the program, all memory locations are initialized to zero, except those
specified in the “.asc” file, as shown in the provided codes.
 The memory is in big-endian byte order.
 The memory is in the following format: e.g. Store a 32-bit number 0xaabbccdd in
memory address 0x0 – 0x3.
Mem[0]
Address 0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3
Content aa bb cc dd
2.4. Conditions that the MySPIM should halt
If one of the following situations is encountered, the global flag Halt is set to 1, and hence the
simulation halts.
 An illegal instruction is encountered.
 Jumping to an address that is not word-aligned (being multiple of 4).
 The address of lw or sw is not word-aligned.
 Accessing data or jumping to an address that is beyond the memory.
Note: The instructions beyond the list of instructions in Appendix A, Figure 1 are illegal.
2.5. Format of the input machine code file
MySPIM takes hexadecimal formatted machine codes, with filename xxx.asc, as input. An
example of .asc file is shown below. Text after “#” on any line is treated as comments.
20010000 # addi $1, $0, 0
200200c8 # addi $2, $0, 200
10220003 # beq $1, $2, 3
00000020 # delay slot
20210001 # addi $1, $1, 1
00000020 # no operation
The simulation ends when an illegal instruction, such as 0x00000000, is encountered.
2.6. Note on branch addressing
The branch offset in MIPS, and hence in MySPIM, is relative to the next instruction, i.e. (PC+4).
For example:
Assembly Code
beq $1, $2, label
beq $3, $4, label
label: beq $5, $6, label
Machine Codes
4 1 2 0x0001
4 3 4 0x0000
4 5 6 0xffff
Opcode Rs Rt offset
6 bits 5 bits 5 bits 16 bits
3. Resources
3.1. Files provided
Please download the following files from the WebCourses:
spimcore.c
spimcore.h
project.c
These files contain the main program and the other supporting functions of the simulator. You
are required to fill in the functions in project.c. You may also introduce new functions, but do
not modify any other part of the files. You are not allowed to modify spimcore.c and
spimcore.h. All your work should be placed in project.c. Please also avoid input and output
statements as these will interrupt the test cases.
The details are described in Section 4 below.
4. The functions to be filled in
The project is divided into 2 parts. In the first part, you are required to fill in a function (ALU(...))
in project.c that simulates the operations of an ALU.
 ALU(...)
1. Implement the operations on input parameters A and B according to
ALUControl.
2. Output the result (Z) to ALUresult.
3. Assign Zero to 1 if the result is zero; otherwise, assign 0.
4. The following table shows the operations of the ALU.
In the second part, you are required to fill in 9 functions in project.c. Each function simulates the
operations of a section of the datapath. Appendix A, Figure 2 below shows the datapath and the
sections of the datapath you need to simulate color-coded to each of the 9 functions.
In spimcore.c, the function Step() is the core function of the simulator. This function invokes the
9 functions that you are required to implement to simulate the signals and data passing
between the components of the datapath. Read Step() thoroughly in order to understand the
signals and data passing, in order to implement the 9 functions.
ALU Control Meaning
000 Z = A + B
001 Z = A – B
010 if A < B, Z = 1; otherwise, Z = 0
011 if A < B, Z = 1; otherwise, Z = 0 (A and B are unsigned integers)
100 Z = A AND B
101 Z = A OR B
110 Z = Shift B left by 16 bits
111 Z = NOT A
The following shows the specifications of the 9 functions:
 instruction_fetch(...)
1. Fetch the instruction addressed by PC from Mem and write it to instruction.
2. Return 1 if a halt condition occurs; otherwise, return 0.
 instruction_partition(...)
1. Partition instruction into several parts (op, r1, r2, r3, funct, offset, jsec).
2. Read line 41 to 47 of spimcore.c for more information.
 instruction_decode(...)
1. Decode the instruction using the opcode (op).
2. Assign the values of the control signals to the variables in the structure controls
(See spimcore.h file).
The meanings of the values of the control signals:
For MemRead, MemWrite or RegWrite, the value 1 means that enabled, 0
means that disabled, 2 means “don’t care”.
For RegDst, Jump, Branch, MemtoReg or ALUSrc, the value 0 or 1 indicates the
selected path of the multiplexer; 2 means “don’t care”.
The following table shows the meaning of the values of ALUOp.
3. Return 1 if a halt condition occurs; otherwise, return 0.
 read_register(...)
1. Read the registers addressed by r1 and r2 from Reg, and write the read values
to data1 and data2 respectively.
 sign_extend(...)
1. Assign the sign-extended value of offset to extended_value.
 ALU_operations(...)
1. Apply ALU operations on data1, and data2 or extended_value (determined by
ALUSrc).
2. The operation performed is based on ALUOp and funct.
3. Apply the function ALU(...).
4. Output the result to ALUresult.
5. Return 1 if a halt condition occurs; otherwise, return 0.
 rw_memory(...)
1. Use the value of MemWrite or MemRead to determine if a memory write
operation or memory read operation or neither is occurring.
2. If reading from memory, read the content of the memory location addressed by
ALUresult to memdata.
Value (Binary) Meaning
000 ALU will do addition or “don’t care”
001 ALU will do subtraction
010 ALU will do “set less than” operation
011 ALU will do “set less than unsigned” operation
100 ALU will do “AND” operation
101 ALU will do “OR” operation
110 ALU will shift left extended_value by 16 bits
111 The instruction is an R-type instruction
3. If writing to memory, write the value of data2 to the memory location
addressed by ALUresult.
4. Return 1 if a halt condition occurs; otherwise, return 0.
 write_register(...)
1. Write the data (ALUresult or memdata) to a register (Reg) addressed by r2 or r3.
 PC_update(...)
1. Update the program counter (PC).
The file spimcore.h is the header file which contains the definition of a structure storing the
control signals and the prototypes of the above 10 functions.
NOTE: You should avoid input and output operations in project.c. These operations are
handled by spimcore.
5. Operation of the Simulator
The files spimcore.c and project.c should be compiled together. Here is an example of how that
may be done in an UNIX environment. First compile:
$ gcc -o spimcore spimcore.c project.c
After compilation, to begin the simulation, you can type the following command in UNIX
(replace <filename> with the correct name of the input file on your system):
$ ./spimcore <filename>.asc
The command prompt
cmd:
should appear. The simulation works with the following commands (both lowercase and
uppercase letter are accepted):
r “Register” - Display register contents
m “Memory” - Display memory contents
s “Step” – Attempt to run the instruction located at the current PC
c “Continue” – Attempt to run all instructions, beginning with PC
h “Halt” – Check to see if the simulation has halted
p “Print” – Prints a copy of the input file
g “Controls” – Display the most recent control signals
x “Quit” – terminate the simulation
6. Submission Guidelines
Make sure that your program can be compiled using the commands in section 5. Programs
that do not compile will be penalized a minimum of 20 points.
Submit project.c online through WebCourses.
You are only required to submit project.c. No additional report to summarize your work is
required. Therefore, you should provide any explanations via comments in your project.c file
for potential partial credit.
